# 🎉 DEPLOYMENT FIX COMPLETE!

## ✅ What I Fixed:

### **Problem:**
Streamlit Cloud was using **Python 3.13.9**, but TensorFlow 2.16.2 only supports up to Python 3.12.

### **Solution:**
1. ✅ Created `.python-version` file → Forces Python 3.12
2. ✅ Created `runtime.txt` file → Specifies Python 3.12
3. ✅ Updated `requirements.txt` → Changed to TensorFlow 2.18.0 (compatible with Python 3.13)
4. ✅ Pushed changes to GitHub

---

## 🚀 WHAT HAPPENS NOW:

Streamlit Cloud will **automatically detect** the new changes and **redeploy** your app!

### Watch the deployment:
Go to your Streamlit Cloud dashboard and watch the logs. The deployment should now succeed! ✨
