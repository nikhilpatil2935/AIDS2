# GitHub Authentication Fix

## Problem
You're logged in as `nikhilpatil2935` but trying to push to `nikkkhil2935/aids`

## EASIEST SOLUTION: Use GitHub Desktop

1. **Download GitHub Desktop**: https://desktop.github.com/
2. **Install and Sign In** with account: `nikkkhil2935`
3. **Add Repository**:
   - Click "File" → "Add Local Repository"
   - Browse to: `C:\Users\Nikhil\Desktop\AIDS-2`
   - Click "Add Repository"
4. **Publish**:
   - Click "Publish repository" button
   - Uncheck "Keep this code private" (or keep checked if you want it private)
   - Click "Publish Repository"
5. **Done!** ✅

## Alternative: Use Personal Access Token

If you want to use command line:

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "AIDS Project"
4. Select scopes: `repo` (full control)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **COPY THE TOKEN** (you won't see it again!)

Then push with token:
```powershell
git push https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/nikkkhil2935/aids.git main
```

Replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with the token you copied.

## After Successful Push

Once your code is on GitHub, deploy to Streamlit Cloud:

1. Go to: https://share.streamlit.io/
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New app"
4. Select repository: `nikkkhil2935/aids`
5. Branch: `main`
6. Main file: `professional_app.py`
7. Click "Deploy!"

Your app will be live at: `https://aids-nikkkhil2935.streamlit.app`
