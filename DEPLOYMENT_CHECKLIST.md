# 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying your AI Placement Predictor app, ensure all items are checked:

## ✅ Files Ready

- [ ] `professional_app.py` - Main application file
- [ ] `requirements.txt` - All dependencies listed
- [ ] `rf_model_engineered.joblib` - Random Forest model (exists)
- [ ] `ada_model_engineered.joblib` - AdaBoost model (exists)
- [ ] `hybrid_model.h5` - Hybrid Neural Network (exists)
- [ ] `tabular_scaler.joblib` - Scaler for hybrid model (exists)
- [ ] `sample_resume.txt` - Sample resume for testing
- [ ] `.streamlit/config.toml` - Theme configuration
- [ ] `.gitignore` - Git ignore file
- [ ] `README.md` - Project documentation (optional)

## ✅ Code Verification

- [ ] App runs locally without errors (`streamlit run professional_app.py`)
- [ ] All 3 models load successfully
- [ ] Resume upload works (PDF and TXT)
- [ ] Predictions generate correctly
- [ ] Charts and visualizations display
- [ ] No warnings in terminal (all suppressed)
- [ ] History tracking works
- [ ] CSV download works

## ✅ Dependencies Check

Run this to verify all packages install correctly:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Should install:
- [x] streamlit
- [x] pandas
- [x] numpy
- [x] scikit-learn
- [x] joblib
- [x] tensorflow==2.16.2
- [x] PyPDF2

## ✅ GitHub Setup (If using Streamlit Cloud/GitHub)

- [ ] GitHub account created
- [ ] Git installed on your computer
- [ ] Repository name decided (e.g., `placement-predictor`)

## ✅ Deployment Platform Account

Choose one:
- [ ] Streamlit Cloud account (https://share.streamlit.io/) - **Recommended**
- [ ] Hugging Face account (https://huggingface.co/)
- [ ] Render account (https://render.com/)

## ✅ File Size Check

Ensure files are within limits:
- [ ] Total repository size < 1GB
- [ ] `hybrid_model.h5` < 500MB
- [ ] All model files combined < 800MB

If too large, consider:
- Using Git LFS for large files
- Compressing models
- Using external storage

## ✅ Security Check

- [ ] No API keys or secrets in code
- [ ] No personal data in sample files
- [ ] No sensitive information in git history
- [ ] `.gitignore` configured correctly

## ✅ Testing

Test locally before deploying:
1. [ ] Upload sample_resume.txt - extracts data correctly
2. [ ] Select Random Forest - predicts successfully
3. [ ] Select AdaBoost - predicts successfully
4. [ ] Select Hybrid NN with resume - predicts successfully
5. [ ] View strengths/weaknesses - displays correctly
6. [ ] Download history CSV - works

## ✅ Documentation

- [ ] README.md updated with:
  - [ ] Project description
  - [ ] Features list
  - [ ] How to use
  - [ ] Tech stack
  - [ ] Your contact info
- [ ] Screenshots taken (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Demo video recorded (optional)

## ✅ Post-Deployment

After deploying:
- [ ] App URL works
- [ ] Test all features in deployed version
- [ ] Check mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Share link with friends for testing
- [ ] Monitor for errors in platform logs

## 🚀 Quick Deploy Commands

### Option 1: Streamlit Cloud (Easiest)

```bash
# 1. Initialize git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# 2. Create GitHub repo, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/placement-predictor.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# 3. Go to https://share.streamlit.io/ and deploy!
```

### Option 2: Run Deploy Script

```powershell
# Run the automated script
.\deploy.ps1
```

## 📊 Expected Results

After deployment, your app should:
- ✅ Load in < 10 seconds
- ✅ Handle resume uploads instantly
- ✅ Generate predictions in < 2 seconds
- ✅ Display all visualizations correctly
- ✅ Work on mobile devices
- ✅ Support multiple concurrent users

## 🆘 Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Module not found | Check requirements.txt |
| Model file not found | Ensure all .joblib/.h5 files are committed |
| App crashes | Check Streamlit Cloud logs |
| Slow loading | Normal for first load, then cached |
| Import errors | Verify TensorFlow 2.16.2 compatibility |

## 📝 Final Checks

Before sharing your app:
- [ ] Test with different resumes
- [ ] Verify all models work
- [ ] Check on mobile browser
- [ ] Read through all text for typos
- [ ] Test edge cases (very low/high CGPA, etc.)

## ✅ Ready to Deploy!
